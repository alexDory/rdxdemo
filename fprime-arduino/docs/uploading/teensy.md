# Teensy 3.2, 4.0, 4.1

The Teensyduino application should have appeared after running `fprime-util build` and the hex file should already be loaded. If you do not see the hex file, choose the hex file to load into Teensyduino located in `./build-artifacts/<TEENSY_TOOLCHAIN>/<YOUR_DEPLOYMENT>/bin/`. Manually press the reset button on the Teensy to upload the program.

> Change `<TEENSY_TOOLCHAIN>` to your build (i.e. `teensy41`, `teensy32`, etc.).
>
> Change `<YOUR_DEPLOYMENT>` to the name of your F Prime deployment.
