# RP2040 and RP2350 Devices

These steps were tested and successfully uploaded for the following boards:
- Raspberry Pi Pico (RP2040)
- Raspberry Pi Pico W (RP2040)
- Raspberry Pi Pico 2 (RP2350)
- Adafruit Feather RP2040 (RP2040)
- Adafruit KB2040 (RP2040)
- Adafruit Feather RP2350 (RP2350)


## Method 1

Hold down the BOOTSEL button on your device as you plug in the USB cable. A media device should mount to your system (i.e. `RPI-RP2`, `RP2350`). Copy and paste the `<YOUR_DEPLOYMENT>.elf.uf2` file located in `build-artifacts/<YOUR_TOOLCHAIN>/bin/` into the media. The device should automatically unmout and run your deployment. If it does not automatically unmount, then your `.uf2` file is not compatible with the device.

> This method works on Windows as well, as long as you copy your `.uf2` from your WSL disto to your Windows subsystem.

## Method 2

```sh
sudo chmod 0777 /dev/ttyACM0

# Linux
python3 -I ~/.arduino15/packages/rp2040/hardware/rp2040/4.2.0/tools/uf2conv.py --serial /dev/ttyACM0 --family RP2040 --deploy build-artifacts/<YOUR_TOOLCHAIN>/<YOUR_DEPLOYMENT>/bin/<YOUR_DEPLOYMENT>.uf2

# MacOS
python3 -I ~/Library/Arduino15/packages/rp2040/hardware/rp2040/4.2.0/tools/uf2conv.py --serial /dev/ttyACM0 --family RP2040 --deploy build-artifacts/<YOUR_TOOLCHAIN>/<YOUR_DEPLOYMENT>/bin/<YOUR_DEPLOYMENT>.uf2
```

> Change `<YOUR_DEPLOYMENT>` to the name of your F Prime deployment.
> 
> Yes, use `--family RP2040` when uploading to the `RP2350` boards.
