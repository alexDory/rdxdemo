# nRF52840 Chips

! There is no support for Linux. Only Windows and MacOS is supported.

These steps were tested and successfully uploaded for the following boards:
- Adafruit Feather nRF52840
- Adafruit Circuit Playground Bluefruit

Double press on the reset button on the device to set it to programming mode. Then run the following commands below.

## Windows (WSL)
Copy over the `Deployment.zip` file to your Windows directory. You can put it anywhere, but for this example I will put it in the `Downloads` folder.
```sh
cp build-artifacts/<YOUR_TOOLCHAIN>/<YOUR_DEPLOYMENT>/bin/<YOUR_DEPLOYMENT>.elf.zip /mnt/c/Users/user/Downloads/
```

Open a Powershell or Command Prompt window in the folder you copied the file to, and run:
```sh
~\AppData\Local\Arduino15\packages\adafruit\hardware\nrf52\1.6.1\tools\adafruit-nrfutil\win32\adafruit-nrfutil.exe --verbose dfu serial -pkg <YOUR_DEPLOYMENT>.elf.zip -p COM3 -b 115200 --singlebank
```

> Change `<YOUR_DEPLOYMENT>` to the name of your F Prime deployment.
> 
> Change `COM3` to the COM port connected to the device. You can find the COM port under `Device Manager` -> `Ports (COM & LPT)`.


## MacOS

```sh
~/.arduino15/packages/adafruit/hardware/nrf52/1.6.1/tools/adafruit-nrfutil/macos/adafruit-nrfutil --verbose dfu serial -pkg build-artifacts/<YOUR_TOOLCHAIN>/<YOUR_DEPLOYMENT>/bin/<YOUR_DEPLOYMENT>.elf.zip -p /dev/tty.usbmodem12345 -b 115200 --singlebank
```

> Change `<YOUR_DEPLOYMENT>` to the name of your F Prime deployment.
> 
> Change `/dev/tty.usbmodem12345` to the serial port connected to the device.
